# **CS 225 Data Structures**

# **Development**

## **Week 1 (2021/11/04)**

**Ideas:** Landmark path, Eulerian path

**Main problem:** Our project goal is to find the shortest route between two airports and display the route on the map.

**Dataset:** OpenFlights: route database and airport database

**Traversal** BFS

**Covered Algorithm**: Shortest path - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm or Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.

**Possible solutions for complex and uncovered options**:
